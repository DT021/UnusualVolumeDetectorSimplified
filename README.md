# UnusualVolumeDetectorSimplified
A simplified method of the market scanner SamPom100 already created. All credit for the original code goes to him, I just simplified it for people who aren't as familiar with Python

Open the master file in Python Notebook or copy and paste the code directly into an empty cell of your Python Notebook and hit run to scan all available tickers for volume anomolies. This needs to be done in the directory with all the other data provided by SamPom100 so Python can pull the necessary data to make the calculations
